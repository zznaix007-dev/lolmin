PenTest & Security checklist

1. Threat model
   - Identify assets: agent binaries, server API, recordings, logs, secrets.
   - Actors: operator, admin, attacker (network), malicious insider.
   - Trust boundaries: agent ↔ server (mTLS), operator UI ↔ server (HTTPS + AD).

2. Tests to perform
   - Auth tests: LDAP brute force, weak password, session fixation, JWT tampering.
   - mTLS/MITM: ensure server requires client certs when configured; attempt MITM with forged cert.
   - Privilege escalation: agent runs as non‑admin — test whether operations can escalate privileges.
   - Installer tamper: verify installer signature check, simulate tampered installer.
   - Replay & replay protection for signaling and control messages.
   - Recording protection: ensure recordings cannot be downloaded without proper RBAC.
   - Logging integrity: verify append‑only behavior; attempt log tamper.
   - Input validation: process kill requests, file transfers, command execution.
   - Network resilience: latency, packet loss, TURN failover.

3. Tools & scope
   - Static code review (SAST).
   - Dynamic tests (DAST), manual penetration testing.
   - External third‑party pentest scheduled after internal review.
