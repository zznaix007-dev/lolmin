Agent Electron skeleton

Run in development:
- npm install
- npm start

Notes
- This is a minimal skeleton. Implement mediasoup-client signaling in `renderer.js`, handle auth to server, and ensure tray/consent flows.
- Sign the built exe with your code signing cert and produce an installer (NSIS/Wix) for deployment.
