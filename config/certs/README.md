Place your CA and certificate files here for mTLS and code signing.

Expected files (examples):
- ca.pem (root CA)
- server-cert.pem
- server-key.pem
- agent-cert.pem
- agent-key.pem

For development you can generate a CA and sign server/agent certs with OpenSSL. In production use your organization's PKI.
